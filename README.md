# TYPO3 (core) command line binary

*This is a friendly fork of [TYPO3/cms-cli](https://github.com/TYPO3/cms-cli). It's sole purpose
is to avoid that `helhum/typo3-console` circumvents installation of the core cli binary in `bin/typo3`.*


## Installation

```sh
$ composer require bnf/combat-helhum-console-autocracy:^1.0
```

## Usage

```sh
$ bin/typo3 list
```
